Thoughts
--------

Seph is a mostly functional version of Ioke. This means:
- No assignment
  - Only assignment as local variables
- Lexical scopes
  - That includes the local variables and can modify them
  - This means you can always control the scope of mutability
  - Figure out real light weight way of working with these
- Kilim for light weight threads
- Tail recursion, the same as Erjang implementation
- The general way of creating new objects is to use the with() operator
- No global functions, everything is based on polymorphic calls
- Stuff to figure out:
  - How to handle operator shuffling
  - Decide how to dynamic to be. Eval, creating message chains from scratch and applying them?
  - Decide where the hard limits in the language should be
    - Overriding assignment?
    - Assigning places?
    - Overriding literal creation?
- Syntax macros at parse time - looked up monomorphically (figure out namespacing of these)
- Enumerable implementations that take code chains, for example
  These should be polymorphic regular macros
- Probably compile everything from start - need to compile and retain AST though, so that anything can take a code chain, transform and execute that

- Add Clojure style metadata
- Add all Clojure's concurrency primitives, probably.


-- Unify fns and methods?



Another description:
 Object-functional hybrid - prototype-oriented
 Immutable objects. Only polymorphic message sends for lookup.
 Local variables mutable, and lexically closable inside methods
 Erlang-style lightweight threads
 Tail recursion
 Parse time syntax macros - Common Lisp style
 Polymorphic macros that take code chains at run time.

Name:
-------
Seph (as in Sephiroth, Sephora)   short: .sp, .se


Use Kilim from KrestenKrab for light weight processes
Tail recursion: use Krestens Erjang approach for this


Sort out design on how to run a new process




Probably start out very simple, quite static, none of the really crazy stuff from Ioke.


----

See whether it's possible to create a bytecode format immediately. See if it's possible to reduce the native functionality to a minimum. Try to create a general interface for BIF's. Take inspiration from
Smalltalk on this.


----

More than one parent or no parents:

Foo with(abc: 42) withParent(Bar)
Foo with(abc: 42) withoutParent(Foo)
Foo with(abc: 42) withoutParents

----

Use regular Floats instead of BigDecimal always.
Use gnu.math directly

How to handle user extensions of core types? Two ideas:
Allow global changes to a "platform" style object that includes all the bound names. This will not change existing objects though:

  platform Text = Text withParent(Extensions)

where Text= will synchronize and set the slot on platform to be the new value.

The other choice is to allow user extension of certain objects. This should be done using a Clojure atom style thingy, to ensure safe update:

  Text appendCoreExtension!(Extensions)

Core extensions can be removed and added at this level, but the real parents of Text can never be removed or changed:
It is only things that are implemented in Java land that can have core extensions - and not all of these have it either - only where it makes sense.

  class TextBase {
    private final SephObject parent1;
    private final SephObject parent1;
    private final ClojureRef<PersistentList> coreExtensions = new ClojureRef(PersistentList.EMPTY);
  }
