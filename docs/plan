Plan to get somewhere working:
------------------------------

- Implement a simple parser
    - add tests and missing pieces compared to IokeParser
    - add numbers
    - add lists and maps

- Implement a basic object model
- Implement a simplistic interpreter for simple mimicking (or possibly a bytecode engine)
- Implement a simple, functional operator shuffling
- Implement a simplistic interpreter for defining and running methods.
- Generate simple bytecode for the above
- Integrate KILIM into simple bytecode
- Integrate tail recursion into the above



What to ignore for now:
 - Syntactic macros and regular macros
 - Lexical scopes
 - Mutable locals
