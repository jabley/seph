Plan to get somewhere working:
------------------------------

- Unify methods and fns? Code will have both an object scope and a lexical scope. Lookup will use lexical scope first and only fall back on object after that. Force object by doing @.
    Setting things will be easy - since we know they will happen at the lexical level. No need to lookup things in the object scope.

To implement for fact:
 - Top level notation
 - local assignment
 - methods:
  - method
  - simple arguments
  - local assignment in method
  - ==
  - *
  - -
  - println


Lexical scopes:
 - sent to every invocation of something. BIF's will need to be able to take:
         ThreadContext, Scope, Self         

 - local variables
 - pointer to outer scope 

is the object scope separate from the lexical scope? does a lexical scope capture self? ... probably not - it would be hard to implement methods correctly in that case.
