Plan to get somewhere working:
------------------------------

- Add lists, maps and sets.
  - Add tests for them, checking with a coverage tool
- Implement a simplistic interpreter for simple mimicking (or possibly a bytecode engine)
- Implement a simple, functional operator shuffling
- Implement a simplistic interpreter for defining and running methods.
- Generate simple bytecode for the above
- Integrate KILIM into simple bytecode
- Integrate tail recursion into the above



What to ignore for now:
 - Syntactic macros and regular macros
 - Lexical scopes
 - Mutable locals
