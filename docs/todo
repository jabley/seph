Current compilation is missing several pieces:
- Abstractions are currently not compiled to be tail recursive...
- Invoking things with arguments cannot handle keyword arguments (important for the "with" method)
- Abstractions can't be compiled if they take arguments
- Possibly have a few shortcircuited things like if, + etc. Make that use a SwitchPoint that invalidates if something with that name is redefined
     specifically inline things like "nil", "true", "false", etc
- Make some specialized activateWith methods with different arity, taking MethodHandle, SephObject and possibly Message
- Actually make a simple pic implementation


- Rearrange so receiver comes before SThread and LexicalScope
