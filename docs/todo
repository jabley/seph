Current compilation is missing several pieces:
- Possibly have a few shortcircuited things like if, + etc. Make that use a SwitchPoint that invalidates if something with that name is redefined
     specifically inline things like "nil", "true", "false", etc
        See if it's possible to implement if-statements using GWT
- Lexical scopes - compile based on what variables the compiler can see. Do things as a message send if it can't be seen in a static scope.
    Or consider it at least
- Make toplevel also use the compiler
- Invoking things that create abstractions doesn't work... (should be very easy to sort out)
- Invoking things with arguments cannot handle keyword arguments (important for the "with" method)
- Compile assignments

- Check the performance of tail recursive odd/even, and larger fib...

  - false  (DONE)
  - nil    (DONE)
  - with
