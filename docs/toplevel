There is one toplevel lexical scope (where variables can be mutated) for each file. If a keyword argument is used, those things will be exporteda as a module. Things in the non-keyword arguments will be evualated and those
values will be available. A file containing this:

  foo: 42,
  10 * 5,
  4 * 3,
  12 * 3,
  bar: 55
  
is the same as:

  value1 = 10 * 5
  value2 = 4 * 3
  value 3= 12 * 3

  Module with(
    foo: 42,
    bar: 55,
    values: [value1, value2, value3]
  )

The positional arguments will be evaluated before the module creation, and then added to the module.

There is no global scope. You can get access to another file in one way (inspired by Newspeak):

  fastercsv: from("lib/seph/faster_csv"),

the fastercsv cell will contain a Module instance with the values specified.
